            <h2>Python by writing code and visualizing execution</h2>

            <p>
              This free educational application allows teachers and students to write Python scripts directly in the web
              browser, execute those scripts, single-step <b>forwards and backwards</b> through execution, and view the
              run-time state of all data structures.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rather than displaying a bland text-based console, the Online Python Tutor provides a rich visualization
              of variables, heap objects, and stack frames. For example, the following code:
            </p>

            <p>x = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]<br />y = x<br />z = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]</p>

            <p>will be visualized as the following HTML diagram, which properly shows aliasing relationships:</p>

        <td class="activityTd">
          <div>
            <h1>Solve, Debug and Optimize</h1>
            <h2>programming problems by writing or changing written Python code</h2>

            <p>
              The Online Python Tutor also allows students to practice solving programming problems like those they
              would receive for class assignments or technical job interviews.
            </p>

            <p>
              It provides web-based interfaces for writing/editing solution and test code, executing on a series of
              graded test inputs, and showing what tests passed and failed.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can easily create new practice problems by writing them in a lightweight plain text format. The
              problem specification format allows constraints like
              <i>"code diffs must be less than N lines"</i> (used for debugging problems) and
              <i>"tests must terminate in at most M executed Python lines"</i> (used for optimization problems).

            <p>
              The above screenshot shows passed and failed tests. The user can click on the "Debug me" button besides
              one of the sad faces to debug why the program failed on a particular test.
